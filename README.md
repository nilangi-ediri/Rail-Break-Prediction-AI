# Rail-Break-Prediction-AI

Collaborated with insightfactory.ai on a university project to develop a machine learning classification model predicting rail breaks across Australia's railway network within a 30-day horizon. Leveraging historical sensor data and an advanced XGBoost architecture on Insigfactor.ai's platform, the model achieved a positive class F1 score of 0.5224, securing 6th place on the leaderboard. The project delivered actionable insights to enhance rail safety and operational efficiency.
